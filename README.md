# Web Optimization Project
This is a project that concerns about the implementation of some practices of web optimizations,
focuses in JS functions and rendering performance optimizations based on PageSpeed scores and
Chrome devtools Performance tools.

*~~The design is from Udacity's course~~*

## Web optimizations

* Increased PageSpeed Score on `index.html`
* Optimized `views/js/main.js` making `views/pizza.html` render at 60fps
* Optimized pizza slider to resize pizzas' images in less than 5ms on `views/pizza.html`
